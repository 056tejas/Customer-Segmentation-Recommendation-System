# 🧠 Customer Segmentation & Recommendation System

A full-fledged **Data Science project** that clusters customers based on behavior and generates **personalized product recommendations**. The solution includes a **Flask-based web app** and an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for deep business insights.

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides a detailed view of customer segments and their behavior. It includes:

- 📌 **Segment KPIs**: Avg. Spend, Total Transactions, Recency
- 📈 **Cluster Distribution**: Bar and Pie Charts for segment sizes
- 📉 **Segment-wise Spend & Transaction Comparison**
- 🔍 **Interactive Drill-down**: Filter by Segment, Country, or Customer ID
- ✅ **Recommendations Table**: Easily view suggested product categories per customer

> All visuals are arranged in multiple pages to maintain clarity, aesthetics, and focus per insight.

---

## 🧠 Highlights & Learnings

- Real-world **customer segmentation** using RFM metrics and KMeans clustering
- Built a **rule-based recommendation engine** tailored to each segment
- Developed a clean and responsive **Flask Web App** for user interaction
- Integrated **Power BI** for executive-level visualization and storytelling
- Mastered **PCA**, **feature scaling**, and **unsupervised learning**

---

## 💡 Recommendations Logic

Customers are grouped into clusters using unsupervised learning (KMeans). Based on each segment's behavior (e.g., high spenders vs low frequency), products from specific categories are recommended.
